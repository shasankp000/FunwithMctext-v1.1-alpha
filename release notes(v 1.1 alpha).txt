# Fun with Mctext 
# Release 1.1 alpha
# Original Author : shasankp000 (www.github.com/shasankp000)
# This is a game which is minecraft, but entirely a text based, choice selection based game.
# Messages similar to minecraft text console , which makes the player feel familiar to minecraft(if they have played it before)
# Current features include: 
> the command block(includes the console, and some commands of the minecraft console)
> the redstone torch(available, but not implemented in inventory or usage yet)
> the redstone dust(available and can be used)
> the redstone repeater(available and can be used)
> the lever (available and can be used)
> the console commands are based on the 1.16.2 minecraft version. (very recent one. i always keep updated with the versions.)
## Currently the command block operates on its default power source , that is a button placed near it. The redstone power feature will be added in the next update. ##
## Fixed the unwanted game pause with no input recognition after some choices. Now game will ask the player what the player wants to do next after each action ##
## The default gamemode is set to Creative mode. The gamemode change options with other gamemodes will be added in the next update ##
## A new debugger will be added to debug buggy codes ##
## A new feature will be added so that the player can input custom commands (works only on the custom created command blocks, not the game defined ones.)
